# RoboVMKotlin

## Technologies

* [RoboVM](https://robovm.com/) - Write in Java or any JVM language (e.g. Java, Kotlin, Groovy, etc...) and target both Android and iOS
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - JVM language by the JetBrains team that is statically typed, has null-safety features, extension methods, and more...

## What it does?
This is just a hello world app created from the RoboVM Studio with a slight modification.

* Android - Calls the /online-auctions API and allows you to show a new catalog name for every click
* iOS - Every click returns the next number (still working on porting the functionality for the Android counterpart)
